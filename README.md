# Cross-16
My favourite DOS based software used to create Z80, 6809 or other HEX Eprom files for writing your own machine language files

This software runs in DOS
You create your .ASM file the compile it using the C16.exe and it outputs .HEX file

I uploaded this for people who do retro computing so they can make their .ASM files

I will try to find the manual for this old software

The .bat files show the command line use so look in there for help

Anyone who uses this could you please send me a email at pcboardrepair@gmail.com or 256tb.hippocampus@gmail.com with any comments

If anything is missing from this repostitory please contact me and I will do my best to resolve the issue

Thanks
David
